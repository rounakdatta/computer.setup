### computer.setup
Minimalist Ansible playbook to set up your new system with speed ðŸš€.

#### Start
To set up git SSH access and password store, as a first step, we need to place the keys as:
- SSH private key is to be kept at `~/.ssh/keys/personal.pem`
- GPG private key is to be kept at `~/.secrets/private.key`
- GPG public key is to be kept at `~/.secrets/public.key`

If you're transporting these keys from an existing system, [this gist](https://gist.github.com/rounakdatta/e8555f6feab148a2337b05dce50a71e8) might be useful.

Then it's as easy as issuing a shell command:
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rounakdatta/computer.setup/master/start.sh | /bin/bash
```
